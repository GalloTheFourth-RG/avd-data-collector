Collects ARM resource inventory, Azure Monitor metrics, and Log Analytics (KQL) query results from your AVD deployment and exports them as a portable **collection pack** — a ZIP of JSON files you can feed into any tooling.

**No analysis, no scoring, no proprietary logic.** Raw data and metadata, fully transparent.

## 🔍 What is Aperture?

**Aperture is an end-to-end health and design assessment for Azure Virtual Desktop.** It's built and run by Microsoft CSAs (Customer Success Architects) to help customers understand the current state of their AVD environment and make confident decisions about cost, security, scale, resilience, and user experience.

Aperture comes in two parts:

| Part | What it is | Who runs it |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Aperture Data Collector** (this repo) | Public, open-source, read-only PowerShell script. Gathers configuration and telemetry from Azure and packages it into a portable ZIP. | **You** (the customer), in your own tenant |
| **Aperture Assessment** | Private analysis engine that ingests the ZIP offline and produces the report. | **Your Microsoft CSA**, on their workstation |

You never have to install or trust the analysis engine — it never touches your tenant. All it sees is the ZIP you choose to send back.

### What you get back

After your CSA runs the assessment against the collection pack, you receive:

- **An interactive HTML dashboard** — 24 tabs covering health, cost, security, networking, profiles, scaling, BCDR, right-sizing, Windows 365 readiness, and more. Opens in any browser, no dependencies, fully self-contained.
- **75+ CSV exports** — every finding broken out so you can feed it into your own tooling, tickets, or reporting.
- **An executive summary** — graded scorecard (Health / Security / UX / Resiliency / Cost) suitable for sharing with leadership.
- **A Priority Matrix** — findings ranked by impact and effort, so you know where to start.
- **Remediation scripts** — `-WhatIf`-safe PowerShell snippets for the most common fixes (drain mode, accelerated networking, idle VM cleanup, disk throttling review).

### What problems it helps solve

- "We're about to expand VDI — is our current design ready?"
- "Are we overspending on VM sizes / disk tiers / reservations?"
- "Why are logons slow? Why are users disconnecting?"
- "Is our profile / FSLogix storage architecture going to hold?"
- "Are we resilient to a zone or region failure?"
- "Should we move some users to Windows 365 instead?"
- "Where are our security gaps — screen capture, watermarking, private endpoints, Intune coverage?"

### How a typical engagement runs

1. **30-minute intro call** with your CSA — scope, permissions, what's collected
2. **You run the collector** (this script) against your subscription(s) — read-only, no agents, ~1 hour
3. **You send the ZIP back** to your CSA
4. **CSA produces the report offline** — typically a few business days
5. **60-minute readout call** to walk through findings, then you keep the HTML report and CSVs

### What it is NOT

- Not a monitoring tool — it's a point-in-time assessment
- Not a replacement for Microsoft Support — if you have an active incident, open a case in parallel
- Not a sales pitch for any specific product — findings are based on your data and Microsoft's published guidance
- Not a black box — every line of the collector is open source, and you can inspect the ZIP before sharing

## 📋 What It Collects

| Category | Data | API Source |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **Host Pools** | Configuration, load balancing, RDP settings | `Get-AzWvdHostPool` |
| **Session Hosts** | Status, agent version, health, active sessions | `Get-AzWvdSessionHost` |
| **Virtual Machines** | Size, OS, zones, disks, NICs, security profile, extensions | `Get-AzVM` |
| **VM Scale Sets** | VMSS config + individual instance details | `Get-AzVmss` |
| **Application Groups** | App group types, host pool assignments | `Get-AzWvdApplicationGroup` |
| **Scaling Plans** | Autoscale definitions, schedules, pool assignments | ARM API |
| **Metrics** | CPU, memory, disk IOPS per VM (configurable lookback) | `Get-AzMetric` |
| **Log Analytics** | 39 KQL queries — connections, errors, profiles, Shortpath, agent health, table discovery | `Invoke-AzOperationalInsightsQuery` |
| **Capacity Reservations** | CRG utilization, allocated vs used capacity | ARM REST API |
| **Quota Usage** | Per-region vCPU quota (current / limit) | `Get-AzVMUsage` |
| **Reserved Instances** | RI orders, SKUs, terms, expiry, utilization | `Az.Reservations` |
| **Cost Data** ⁺ | Per-VM and infrastructure costs (last 30 days, amortized — RI costs spread across covered VMs) | Cost Management API |
| **Network Topology** ⁺ | Subnets, VNets, NSG rules, private endpoints, NAT Gateway | `Az.Network` + ARM |
| **Image Analysis** ⁺ | Gallery image versions, marketplace freshness | ARM API |
| **Storage** ⁺ | FSLogix storage accounts, file shares, capacity | `Az.Storage` |
| **Orphaned Resources** ⁺ | Unattached disks, unused NICs, unassociated PIPs | ARM |
| **Diagnostics/Alerts** ⁺ | Diagnostic settings, alert rules, activity log | ARM REST API |
| **Governance** ⁺ | Policy assignments, resource tags | ARM REST API |

> ⁺ = Extended collection (opt-in via individual flags or `-IncludeAllExtended`)

### Disk performance data

Disk IOPS, queue depth, and throttling signals come from **Azure Monitor platform metrics** (`Get-AzMetric`) -- not from Log Analytics performance counters or a Data Collection Rule. This means disk performance analysis works for any VM with `Reader` access, even when AVD Insights / perf counters are not configured.

Metrics collected (best-effort, per VM):

| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `OS Disk IOPS Consumed Percentage` | OS disk throttling detection |
| `OS Disk Queue Depth` | OS disk saturation / queueing |
| `Data Disk IOPS Consumed Percentage` | Data disk throttling detection (e.g. FSLogix profile disks attached as data disks) |

These are aggregated alongside CPU and memory metrics and surface in the evidence pack's **Storage & Disks** tab, VM right-sizing logic, and the `Review-DiskThrottling` remediation script.

Log Analytics perf counters (`LogicalDisk`, `PhysicalDisk`) are **not required** for disk analysis. If the AVD Insights DCR is configured, additional per-process telemetry (CPU / memory per process) is used elsewhere -- but disk throttling is independent of that.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

This section documents the security posture of the Aperture Data Collector for review by information security, compliance, and risk teams.

> **One-page version for your security team:** [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — read-only guarantee, no-telemetry pledge, what is never collected, credential handling, download verification, and data retention guidance.

### Security Guarantees

| Guarantee | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Read-only** | Every API call is a `GET` or read-only cmdlet (`Get-AzVM`, `Get-AzWvdHostPool`, etc.). The script never creates, modifies, or deletes any Azure resource. |
| **No outbound data transfer** | All collected data is written to the local file system only. The script makes no calls to external services, telemetry endpoints, or third-party APIs. |
| **No credential storage** | The script does not write credentials, tokens, or secrets to output files. Authentication uses module-managed sessions (`Az.Accounts` and optional `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication` for `-IncludeIntune`). |
| **Transparent output** | All output is plain JSON — fully inspectable, filterable, and redactable before sharing. |
| **No executable code in output** | The collection pack ZIP contains JSON data files, a metadata manifest, and optionally a diagnostic log. No scripts, binaries, or executable content. |
| **Signed & auditable** | The script is open source (MIT). Your security team can review every line of code before execution. |

### What the Script Accesses

> **Detailed setup guide:** See [docs/PERMISSIONS.md](docs/PERMISSIONS.md) for the full RBAC matrix, setup commands, custom role definitions, and troubleshooting.

| Azure Resource | Access Type | Required Role | Purpose |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| Subscriptions | Read | Reader | Enumerate AVD resources |
| Host pools, session hosts, app groups | Read | Reader | AVD inventory |
| Virtual machines, NICs, disks | Read | Reader | VM configuration and sizing |
| Azure Monitor metrics | Read | Reader | CPU, memory, disk performance |
| Log Analytics workspaces | Query | Log Analytics Reader | Session, connection, and error telemetry |
| Cost Management API | Read | Cost Management Reader | Per-VM cost data (opt-in only) |
| Network resources | Read | Reader | Subnet, NSG, VNet topology (opt-in only) |
| Storage accounts | Read | Reader | FSLogix share analysis (opt-in only) |
| Reserved Instances | Read | Reservations Reader | RI utilization (opt-in only) |
| Intune managed devices | Read | Global Reader or Intune Administrator | Session host enrollment cross-reference (opt-in: `-IncludeIntune`, separate Graph sign-in) |

> **Intune note:** `-IncludeIntune` uses Microsoft Graph API with a **separate browser sign-in** (not Azure ARM). Requires the `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication` PowerShell module. See [docs/PERMISSIONS.md](docs/PERMISSIONS.md#intune-integration-separate-auth) for full setup details.

### What Is NOT Collected

The script does **not** access or collect:

- Passwords, secrets, certificates, or key vault contents
- File share contents, user files, or profile data
- Application data or database contents
- Azure AD/Entra ID user attributes beyond UPN (for session correlation)
- Network traffic or packet captures
- OS-level configuration (registry, local policies, Group Policy)
- Any data from on-premises or non-Azure systems

### Network Behaviour

The script communicates with Azure management plane APIs (`management.azure.com`, `api.loganalytics.io`) and, when `-IncludeIntune` is enabled, Microsoft Graph (`graph.microsoft.com`) using your authenticated module sessions. It does not:

- Open any listening ports
- Make DNS queries to non-Azure domains
- Establish outbound connections to any IP or domain not owned by Microsoft Azure
- Use WebSockets, SignalR, or persistent connections
- Download any external content or dependencies at runtime

### PII Scrubbing

Add `-ScrubPII` to anonymize all identifiable data **before** it is written to disk:

| Data Category | Example Before | Example After |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| VM names | `avd-prod-vm-001` | `Host-3F7C` |
| Host pool names | `HP-Finance-US` | `Pool-D4E5` |
| Usernames (UPN) | `jsmith@contoso.com` | `User-A1B2` |
| Subscription IDs | `12345678-abcd-...` | `Sub-F6A1` |
| Resource groups | `rg-avd-prod` | `RG-B2C3` |
| IP addresses | `10.0.1.50` | `IP-7D8E` |
| ARM resource IDs | `/subscriptions/12345.../rg-prod/...` | `/subscriptions/Sub-F6A1/resourceGroups/RG-B2C3/...` |
| Storage accounts | `stfslogixprod01` | `Storage-9A2B` |
| Subnet names | `snet-avd-prod` | `Subnet-C3D4` |

- Uses **SHA256 hashing** with a per-run random salt
- Same entity always maps to the same anonymous ID within a run (correlations preserved)
- Different runs produce different IDs (no cross-run linkability)
- Scrubbing occurs in memory before any file is written — the raw data never touches disk

```powershell
.\Collect-ApertureData.ps1 `
    -TenantId "your-tenant-id" `
    -SubscriptionIds @("your-sub-id") `
    -LogAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceIds @("/subscriptions/.../workspaces/your-ws") `
    -ScrubPII
```

When `-ScrubPII` is used, a separate **PII key CSV** (`*-PII-KEY.csv`) is written alongside the ZIP. This maps anonymous IDs back to original values for the analyst. Do **not** share the key file unless the recipient needs to correlate findings with real resource names.

### Verify Your Download

Each GitHub release attaches the built `Collect-ApertureData.ps1` as an asset, and GitHub shows its **SHA-256 digest** next to the asset on the [release page](https://github.com/GalloTheFourth-RG/aperture-data-collector/releases/latest). After downloading, confirm your copy matches:

```powershell
(Get-FileHash .\Collect-ApertureData.ps1 -Algorithm SHA256).Hash
```

If the hash differs from the one on the release page, do not run the script — re-download from the official repository. You can also clone the repo and review or run the source directly.

### Inspect Before Sharing

The output ZIP contains only plain JSON files. Before sharing:

1. Unzip the collection pack
2. Open any JSON file in a text editor or VS Code
3. Search for any strings you are uncomfortable sharing
4. Delete or redact specific files, then re-zip

### HIPAA & Healthcare Environments

For healthcare organizations subject to HIPAA:

- The collector does **not** access, process, or store Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Session telemetry from Log Analytics contains UPN and connection metadata only — no clinical data
- Use `-ScrubPII` to anonymize all UPN fields before the data leaves the environment
- The output contains infrastructure configuration and performance metrics — no patient data, medical records, or clinical application data
- The script runs on an administrator workstation and does not interact with clinical systems, EHR databases, or medical devices
- Collection can be performed by your internal team and reviewed before sharing with external consultants

Not included in `-IncludeAllExtended` (separate Graph auth flow). |

### Incident Window

The incident window feature lets you collect a **second, focused set of Azure Monitor metrics and KQL query results** covering a specific past outage or performance event. This sits alongside your baseline data (default 7-day lookback) so your consultant can compare normal-state performance against the incident period side-by-side.

**When to use:** Users reported lag, disconnections, or login failures during a known time window and you want targeted data for root cause analysis.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `-IncludeIncidentWindow` | Collect a second set of metrics and KQL queries for a specific incident period |
| `-IncidentWindowStart` | Start of incident window (datetime). Default: 14 days ago |
| `-IncidentWindowEnd` | End of incident window (datetime). Default: now |

The incident window produces a separate `metrics-incident.json` file and incident-prefixed KQL results (connections, peak concurrency, profile load times, errors, connection quality) that are analyzed alongside baseline data in the evidence pack's **Incident Analysis** tab.

| `-ResumeFrom` | — | Path to a partial output folder from an interrupted run; skips completed steps |
| `-DryRun` | `$false` | Probe Azure permissions and preview collection scope (makes real API calls to test access, but collects no data) |
| `-SkipDisclaimer` | `$false` | Skip the interactive disclaimer prompt |
| `-DisconnectGraphOnExit` | `$false` | When `-IncludeIntune` is used, disconnect Microsoft Graph at the end instead of retaining context for reuse |
| `-MetricsParallel` | `5` | Parallel threads for Azure Monitor metric collection (lower for throttle-sensitive tenants) |
| `-KqlParallel` | `5` | Parallel threads for Log Analytics KQL queries |
| `-OutputPath` | `.` | Directory for the output collection pack |

## 🔗 Offline Analysis Workflow

The collection pack ZIP is designed for offline, disconnected analysis — no Azure credentials required after collection:

1. **Collect** — Run the collector against the customer's Azure environment
2. **Share** — Send the ZIP to the analyst (use `-ScrubPII` to anonymize before sharing)
3. **Analyse** — The analyst ingests the ZIP with their assessment tooling — no Azure access needed

This separation enables:
- **Delegated collection** — someone with Azure access runs the collector; the analyst works offline
- **Privacy control** — PII scrubbing ensures sensitive data never leaves the customer's control
- **Repeatability** — re-analyse the same data with updated tooling or different parameters
- **Archival** — keep collection packs for historical comparison across engagements

---

## ⏱️ Runtime Estimates

Azure Virtual Desktop supports up to **10,000 session hosts per host pool** and **25,000 VMs per subscription per region** ([Azure service limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits)). The collector is designed to handle environments at these scales.

| Environment Size | VMs | Estimated Time |
|-----------------|-----|----------------|
| Small | ~50 | 3–5 min |
| Medium | ~200 | 8–15 min |
| Large | ~500 | 15–25 min |
| Very Large | ~1,500 | 30–60 min |
| Enterprise | ~3,000 | 60–90 min |
| Large Enterprise | 5,000+ | 90–150+ min |

**What drives runtime:**

| Collection Phase | Scales With | Impact |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| ARM resources (host pools, VMs, NICs) | Resource groups | Fast — bulk-fetched per RG |
| Azure Monitor metrics | VM count | **Primary time driver** — per-VM with parallel processing |
| Log Analytics (39 KQL queries) | Workspace count | Moderate — parallelized per workspace |
| Extended collection (costs, network, storage, orphans, diagnostics, alerts) | Subscription scope | Adds 5–15 min when enabled |

**Tips for large environments:**
- Use `-SkipAzureMonitorMetrics` for inventory-only runs (~2–5 min regardless of size)
- Lower `-MetricsParallel` (default 5) and `-KqlParallel` (default 5) for throttle-sensitive tenants
- Reduce `-MetricsLookbackDays` (default 7) to shorten the metrics window
- Use `-MetricsTimeGrainMinutes 60` (default 15) for coarser data with faster collection
- For 5,000+ VM environments, consider collecting during off-peak hours to avoid API throttling
