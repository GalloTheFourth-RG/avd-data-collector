Subject: How to run the AVD data collector

Hi,

Thank you for sharing your environment! To gather diagnostics with the AVD Data Collector, please follow these steps:

1. Open PowerShell 7 (pwsh.exe).
2. Download or copy the latest `Collect-AVDData.ps1` script into a folder on the machine.
3. Log in to Azure:
   ```powershell
   Connect-AzAccount -TenantId <tenant-id>   # interactively sign in
   ```
4. Run the collector specifying your tenant, subscription(s) and any optional parameters. Example:
   ```powershell
   pwsh -NoProfile -Command `
     "& 'C:\path\to\Collect-AVDData.ps1' `
        -TenantId '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' `
        -SubscriptionIds @('11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111') `
        -LogAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceIds @('/subscriptions/1111.../resourceGroups/rg/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/ws') `
        -IncludeCapacityReservations `
        -IncludeQuotaUsage `
        -MetricsLookbackDays 14 `
        -ScrubPII"
   ```
5. Wait for the script to finish; it will display progress and create a folder/ZIP named `AVD-CollectionPack-<timestamp>`.
6. Send the resulting ZIP file (and the `diagnostic.log` inside it if there were issues) to me for analysis.

Feel free to modify the parameters to skip metrics or KQL, change the lookback period, or enable PII scrubbing as needed.

Best,
Your automated AVD assistant
