# KQL Query Reference

The AVD Data Collector includes 36 pre-built KQL queries that run against Log Analytics workspaces. Each query targets specific AVD diagnostic tables and performance counters.

## Prerequisites

Your Log Analytics workspace must have AVD Diagnostics configured. The collector runs `TableDiscovery` first to verify which tables are available.

Required tables vary by query category:
- **WVDConnections** — connection, login, concurrency queries
- **WVDErrors** — error classification, disconnect analysis
- **WVDConnectionNetworkData** — RTT, bandwidth, Shortpath effectiveness
- **WVDCheckpoints** — Shortpath detection, login decomposition
- **WVDAgentHealthStatus** — agent health, version distribution
- **WVDAutoscaleEvaluationPooled** — autoscale activity
- **WVDMultiLinkAdd** — multi-link transport analysis
- **Perf** — CPU/memory process-level performance
- **Event** — Windows event log data

## Customizing Queries

All queries are plain `.kql` files in the `queries/` directory. You can:

1. **Edit existing queries** — adjust filters, time ranges, or aggregation
2. **Add new queries** — create a new `.kql` file and add a dispatch entry in `Collect-AVDData.ps1`
3. **Remove queries** — delete the `.kql` file; the collector skips missing queries automatically

### Adding a New Query

1. Create `queries/kqlMyNewQuery.kql` with your KQL
2. Add to the `$queryDispatchList` in `Collect-AVDData.ps1`:
   ```powershell
   @{ Label = "CurrentWindow_MyNewQuery"; Query = $kqlQueries["kqlMyNewQuery"] }
   ```
3. The results will automatically be included in `la-results.json`

### Query Timeout Considerations

Log Analytics queries don't have a configurable timeout. For large workspaces (>1TB retention), consider:
- Adding `| take N` limits to expensive queries
- Using `| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)` to limit scan range
- Splitting complex joins into simpler queries
