## 1. What Is This Tool?

The AVD Data Collector is a PowerShell script that gathers data from your Azure Virtual Desktop environment and packages it into a portable ZIP file — a **collection pack**.

The collection pack contains raw data only: host pool configurations, VM inventory, performance metrics, and Log Analytics query results. **No analysis, scoring, or recommendations** — just the facts, in plain JSON format.

### What It's For

- **Consultant workflow** — your consultant asks you to run the collector and send the ZIP. They analyze it offline using their own tools, without needing access to your Azure environment.
- **Archival** — capture a point-in-time snapshot of your AVD environment for historical records.
- **Transparency** — everything collected is plain JSON. You can inspect, filter, or redact anything before sharing.

### What It Doesn't Do

- It does **not** modify your Azure environment (read-only operations only)
- It does **not** send data to any external service (everything stays on your machine)
- It does **not** analyze or score your environment (that's done separately)
- It does **not** require any paid licenses

---

## 2. Before You Start

### Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **PowerShell** | Version 7.2 or later (`pwsh.exe`) |
| **Az PowerShell Modules** | Az.Accounts, Az.Compute, Az.DesktopVirtualization, Az.Monitor, Az.OperationalInsights, Az.Resources |
| **Azure Permissions** | **Reader** on subscription(s) containing AVD resources |
| **Log Analytics** | **Reader** or **Log Analytics Reader** on workspace(s) — optional but recommended |

### Optional Modules (for extended collection)

| Module | What It Enables |
|--------|----------------|
| Az.Network | Network topology collection (subnets, NSGs, VNets, private endpoints) |
| Az.Storage | FSLogix storage account and file share analysis |
| Az.Reservations | Reserved Instance data collection |

### Check Your PowerShell Version

```powershell
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

If you see `5.x`, you need PowerShell 7. Install it:

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.PowerShell
```

Or download from: https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=stable

### Install Required Modules

```powershell
Install-Module Az.Accounts, Az.Compute, Az.DesktopVirtualization, Az.Monitor, Az.OperationalInsights, Az.Resources -Scope CurrentUser
```

For extended collection features:

```powershell
Install-Module Az.Network, Az.Storage -Scope CurrentUser
```

---

## 3. Installation

### Option A: One-Line Install (Recommended)

Run this in PowerShell 7 to download the collector and all query files:

```powershell
irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GalloTheFourth-RG/avd-data-collector/main/Install-AVDCollector.ps1" | iex
```

This creates an `avd-data-collector` folder in your current directory with the script and all KQL query files.

### Option B: Clone the Repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/GalloTheFourth-RG/avd-data-collector.git
cd avd-data-collector
```

### Option C: Manual Download

1. Go to https://github.com/GalloTheFourth-RG/avd-data-collector
2. Click **Code** → **Download ZIP**
3. Extract the ZIP to a folder of your choice
4. Open PowerShell 7 and navigate to the extracted folder

---

## 4. Running Your First Collection

### Step 1: Find Your Azure IDs

You need three pieces of information:

**Tenant ID:**
```powershell
Connect-AzAccount
(Get-AzContext).Tenant.Id
```

**Subscription ID(s):**
```powershell
Get-AzSubscription | Select-Object Name, Id
```

**Log Analytics Workspace Resource ID(s):**
```powershell
Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace | Select-Object Name, ResourceId
```

The workspace resource ID looks like:
```
/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/rg-monitoring/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/avd-workspace
```

> **Not sure which workspace?** Check your host pool's diagnostic settings in the Azure Portal: Host Pool → Diagnostic settings → check where logs are being sent.

### Step 2: Preview (Optional but Recommended)

Run a dry run to see what will be collected without actually collecting anything:

```powershell
.\Collect-AVDData.ps1 `
    -TenantId "your-tenant-id" `
    -SubscriptionIds @("your-subscription-id") `
    -DryRun
```

This shows you the VM count, estimated runtime, and which features will run. Takes about 30 seconds.

### Step 3: Run the Collection

```powershell
.\Collect-AVDData.ps1 `
    -TenantId "your-tenant-id" `
    -SubscriptionIds @("your-subscription-id") `
    -LogAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceIds @(
        "/subscriptions/your-sub-id/resourceGroups/your-rg/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/your-workspace"
    )
```

The script shows progress as it runs. A disclaimer prompt appears at the start — read it and type `Y` to proceed.

### Step 4: Wait for Completion

| Environment Size | VMs | Approximate Time |
|-----------------|-----|------------------|
| Small | ~50 | 3–5 minutes |
| Medium | ~200 | 8–15 minutes |
| Large | ~500 | 15–25 minutes |
| Very Large | 1,500+ | 30–60 minutes |

Metrics collection (CPU, memory, disk) is the main time driver. Everything else is fast.

### Step 5: Find Your Output

The collector creates a ZIP file in the current directory:

```
AVD-CollectionPack-20260301-143022.zip    (typically 1–5 MB)
```

That's the file to send to your consultant. Done!

## 5. What Gets Collected

### Core Data (Always Collected)

| Category | What | Source |
|----------|------|--------|
| **Host Pools** | Configuration, load balancing, RDP settings, MaxSessionLimit | `Get-AzWvdHostPool` |
| **Session Hosts** | Status, agent version, health, active sessions, drain mode | `Get-AzWvdSessionHost` |
| **Virtual Machines** | Size, OS, zones, disks, NICs, security profile, extensions, tags | `Get-AzVM` |
| **VM Scale Sets** | VMSS config + individual instance details | `Get-AzVmss` |
| **Application Groups** | App group types, host pool assignments | `Get-AzWvdApplicationGroup` |
| **Scaling Plans** | Autoscale definitions, schedules, pool assignments | ARM API |
| **Metrics** | CPU, memory, disk IOPS per VM (7 days by default) | `Get-AzMetric` |
| **Log Analytics** | 36 KQL queries — connections, errors, profiles, Shortpath, agent health | `Invoke-AzOperationalInsightsQuery` |

### Extended Data (Opt-In)

Enable all at once with `-IncludeAllExtended`, or pick individually:

| Flag | What It Collects |
|------|-----------------|
| `-IncludeCostData` | Per-VM and infrastructure costs (last 30 days) from Cost Management API |
| `-IncludeNetworkTopology` | Subnets, VNets, NSG rules, NAT Gateway, private endpoints |
| `-IncludeImageAnalysis` | Azure Compute Gallery versions, marketplace image freshness |
| `-IncludeStorageAnalysis` | FSLogix storage accounts, file share capacity and quotas |
| `-IncludeOrphanedResources` | Unattached disks, unused NICs, unassociated public IPs |
| `-IncludeDiagnosticSettings` | Host pool diagnostic log forwarding configuration |
| `-IncludeAlertRules` | Azure Monitor alert rules scoped to AVD resource groups |
| `-IncludeActivityLog` | Activity Log entries (last 7 days) showing changes and errors |
| `-IncludePolicyAssignments` | Azure Policy assignments and compliance state |
| `-IncludeResourceTags` | Tags from VMs, host pools, and storage accounts |
| `-IncludeCapacityReservations` | Capacity reservation group utilization |
| `-IncludeQuotaUsage` | Per-region vCPU quota (current usage vs. limit) |

### Separate Opt-In

| Flag | What It Collects | Extra Requirements |
|------|------------------|--------------------|
| `-IncludeReservedInstances` | Reserved Instance orders, SKUs, terms, utilization | `Az.Reservations` module + Reservations Reader role |

> **For the most complete analysis, use `-IncludeAllExtended`.** This enables all extended data (except Reserved Instances, which needs an extra module and role).

---

## 6. Common Scenarios

### Basic Collection (Core Data Only)

ARM inventory + metrics + Log Analytics. Good for a quick run:

```powershell
.\Collect-AVDData.ps1 `
    -TenantId $tenantId `
    -SubscriptionIds @($subId) `
    -LogAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceIds @($workspaceId)
```

### Comprehensive Collection (Recommended)

Everything your consultant needs for a full assessment:

```powershell
.\Collect-AVDData.ps1 `
    -TenantId $tenantId `
    -SubscriptionIds @($subId) `
    -LogAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceIds @($workspaceId) `
    -IncludeAllExtended
```

### Comprehensive + Reserved Instances

Add RI data for reservation coverage analysis:

```powershell
.\Collect-AVDData.ps1 `
    -TenantId $tenantId `
    -SubscriptionIds @($subId) `
    -LogAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceIds @($workspaceId) `
    -IncludeAllExtended `
    -IncludeReservedInstances
```

### Multiple Subscriptions

```powershell
.\Collect-AVDData.ps1 `
    -TenantId $tenantId `
    -SubscriptionIds @("sub-id-1", "sub-id-2", "sub-id-3") `
    -LogAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceIds @("workspace-id-1", "workspace-id-2") `
    -IncludeAllExtended
```

### Fast Inventory-Only (No Metrics)

Skip Azure Monitor metrics for a quick 2–5 minute run:

```powershell
.\Collect-AVDData.ps1 `
    -TenantId $tenantId `
    -SubscriptionIds @($subId) `
    -SkipAzureMonitorMetrics
```

### With PII Scrubbing

Anonymize all identifiable data before the files are written:

```powershell
.\Collect-AVDData.ps1 `
    -TenantId $tenantId `
    -SubscriptionIds @($subId) `
    -LogAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceIds @($workspaceId) `
    -IncludeAllExtended `
    -ScrubPII
```

### With Incident Window

Collect a second set of metrics for a past incident period:

```powershell
.\Collect-AVDData.ps1 `
    -TenantId $tenantId `
    -SubscriptionIds @($subId) `
    -LogAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceIds @($workspaceId) `
    -IncludeIncidentWindow `
    -IncidentWindowStart (Get-Date "2026-02-10 14:00") `
    -IncidentWindowEnd (Get-Date "2026-02-10 16:00")
```

### Longer Metrics History

Collect 14 or 30 days of metrics instead of the default 7:

```powershell
.\Collect-AVDData.ps1 `
    -TenantId $tenantId `
    -SubscriptionIds @($subId) `
    -MetricsLookbackDays 14
```

### Resume an Interrupted Run

If the script was interrupted, resume from where it stopped:

```powershell
.\Collect-AVDData.ps1 `
    -TenantId $tenantId `
    -SubscriptionIds @($subId) `
    -ResumeFrom "AVD-CollectionPack-20260301-143022"
```

### Save Output to a Specific Folder

```powershell
.\Collect-AVDData.ps1 `
    -TenantId $tenantId `
    -SubscriptionIds @($subId) `
    -OutputPath "C:\assessments"
```

## 8. Privacy and Security

### Read-Only Operations

The collector only uses read operations (`Get-*` cmdlets and `GET` REST calls). It does not create, modify, or delete any Azure resources.

### No External Network Calls

Nothing leaves your machine. The script talks to Azure APIs (which you're already authenticated to) and writes the output locally. No telemetry, no phoning home.

### Inspect Before Sharing

The output ZIP contains plain JSON files. You can:

1. Unzip the collection pack
2. Open any JSON file in a text editor or VS Code
3. Search for anything you're uncomfortable sharing
4. Delete or redact specific files before re-zipping

### PII Scrubbing

Add `-ScrubPII` to anonymize all identifiable data **before** it's written to disk:

| Data Type | Example Before | Example After |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| VM names | `avd-prod-vm-001` | `Host-3F7C` |
| Host pool names | `HP-Finance-US` | `Pool-D4E5` |
| Usernames | `jsmith@contoso.com` | `User-A1B2` |
| Subscription IDs | `12345678-...` | `Sub-F6A1` |
| Resource groups | `rg-avd-prod` | `RG-B2C3` |
| IP addresses | `10.0.1.50` | `IP-7D8E` |
| ARM resource IDs | `/subscriptions/12345.../rg-prod/...` | `/subscriptions/Sub-F6A1/resourceGroups/RG-B2C3/...` |

The same entity always maps to the same anonymous ID within a run, so correlations are preserved for analysis. Different runs produce different IDs.

### What Your Consultant Receives

With a standard (non-scrubbed) collection pack, your consultant can see:

- VM names, sizes, and configurations
- Host pool names and settings
- Azure region and zone placement
- Performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- Session connection data from Log Analytics
- Network topology (if extended collection enabled)
- Cost data (if extended collection enabled)

They **cannot** see: passwords, secrets, file share contents, user data, application data, or anything beyond Azure resource configuration and telemetry.

---

## 10. KQL Queries

The collector runs 36 pre-built KQL queries against your Log Analytics workspace(s). These queries target AVD diagnostic tables and provide session-level telemetry that isn't available from ARM APIs.

### Prerequisites

Your workspace needs AVD Diagnostics configured. To check:
1. Azure Portal → your host pool → Diagnostic settings
2. Verify logs are being sent to your Log Analytics workspace
3. Key tables: `WVDConnections`, `WVDErrors`, `WVDConnectionNetworkData`, `WVDCheckpoints`

The collector runs a `TableDiscovery` query first to check which tables are available. Queries targeting missing tables are skipped gracefully.

### Query Categories

| Category | Queries | What They Capture |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Connections** | 7 | Connection summary, success rates, login times, session duration, peak/hourly concurrency, client environment |
| **Errors & Disconnects** | 8 | Error codes, disconnect reasons by host, heatmaps, CPU correlation, reconnection loops |
| **Network & Shortpath** | 8 | RTT/bandwidth quality, cross-region latency, Shortpath usage/effectiveness, transport types |
| **Performance** | 4 | Per-process CPU/memory, CPU percentiles per host with spike analysis |
| **Profiles** | 2 | FSLogix profile load times, login phase decomposition |
| **Agent Health** | 3 | Agent status, version distribution, health check pass/fail rates |
| **Autoscale** | 2 | Scaling activity summary, per-pool evaluations |
| **Discovery** | 1 | Table availability check |
| **Transport** | 1 | Multi-link transport negotiation |

### Customizing Queries

All queries are plain `.kql` files in the `queries/` folder. You can:

- **Edit** existing queries to adjust filters, time ranges, or aggregation
- **Add** new queries — create a `.kql` file and add a dispatch entry in `Collect-AVDData.ps1`
- **Remove** queries — delete the `.kql` file; the collector skips missing queries automatically

---

## 11. Troubleshooting

### "Too Many Requests" / API Throttling

**Cause:** Azure is rate-limiting your API calls.

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce `-MetricsLookbackDays` to 2–3 days
2. Run during off-peak hours (evenings, weekends)
3. Ensure you're using PowerShell 7 (better throttle handling)

### Script Appears to Hang

**Cause:** Collecting metrics for a large number of VMs. This is normal.

**What to do:** Wait. The script shows batch progress. For a faster test run, use `-SkipAzureMonitorMetrics` to skip metrics (2–5 minutes regardless of VM count).

### "WorkspaceNotFound" Errors

**Cause:** The Log Analytics workspace is in a different subscription than your AVD resources.

**Solution:** Ensure your identity has **Reader** or **Log Analytics Reader** on the workspace's subscription — not just the AVD subscription. The collector handles the subscription context switch automatically.

### Missing Az Modules

**Error:** `The term 'Get-AzVM' is not recognized...`

**Solution:**
```powershell
Install-Module Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Wrong PowerShell Version

**Error:** Various syntax errors or module failures.

**Check:**
```powershell
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

If it shows `5.x`, you're running Windows PowerShell. Use `pwsh.exe` (PowerShell 7) instead:
```powershell
winget install Microsoft.PowerShell
```

Then launch `pwsh` and re-run the collector.

### Permission Errors

**Error:** `Authorization failed` or `does not have authorization to perform action`

**Causes and fixes:**

| What You're Trying | Required Role |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Core collection | **Reader** on each subscription |
| Log Analytics queries | **Reader** or **Log Analytics Reader** on workspace |
| Cost data | **Cost Management Reader** on subscription |
| Reserved Instances | **Reservations Reader** at tenant level |

### No KQL Data Returned

**Symptoms:** `la-results.json` contains `NoRowsReturned` or `QueryFailed` entries.

**Common causes:**

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| AVD Insights not configured | Enable diagnostic settings on your host pools to send to Log Analytics |
| Workspace is fresh | Wait 24–48 hours for data to accumulate |
| Wrong workspace | Check your host pool's diagnostic settings to confirm the correct workspace |
| Performance counters missing | Create a Data Collection Rule with Process counters for session stability data |

### Script Interrupted

Use `-ResumeFrom` to continue from where it stopped:

```powershell
.\Collect-AVDData.ps1 `
    -TenantId $tenantId `
    -SubscriptionIds @($subId) `
    -ResumeFrom "AVD-CollectionPack-20260301-143022"
```

The script detects which steps already completed and skips them.

## 12. Frequently Asked Questions

### Does this script change anything in my Azure environment?

No. Every API call is a read operation. The collector does not create, modify, or delete any Azure resources.

### What is the minimum Azure permission I need?

**Reader** on each subscription containing AVD resources. That's it for the basic collection.

For Log Analytics queries, you also need **Reader** or **Log Analytics Reader** on the workspace. For cost data with `-IncludeCostData`, you need **Cost Management Reader**.

### How large is the output file?

Typically 1–5 MB for most environments. Very large environments (1,500+ VMs) with extended collection may produce 5–10 MB.

### Can I inspect the data before sending it?

Yes. The ZIP contains plain JSON files. Unzip it and open any file in a text editor. You can search for specific strings, redact anything you're uncomfortable with, or remove entire files before re-zipping.

### Can I anonymize the data?

Yes. Use `-ScrubPII` to replace all VM names, host pool names, usernames, IPs, subscription IDs, and resource group names with anonymous identifiers before the data is written to disk. The output ZIP never contains real names.

### How long does it take to run?

Most of the time is spent collecting Azure Monitor metrics. Rough estimates:

| VMs | Time (with metrics) | Time (without metrics) |
|-----|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 50 | 3–5 min | 2 min |
| 200 | 8–15 min | 3 min |
| 500 | 15–25 min | 5 min |
| 1,500+ | 30–60 min | 5 min |

### When should I run it?

**During business hours** for the most accurate picture. Metrics and session data captured during peak usage give the best representation of your environment. If you run during off-peak hours when scaling plans have stopped VMs, the data will show many hosts as unavailable — which is normal but may not reflect your typical operating state.

### How many days of metrics should I collect?

The default is 7 days, which covers a full work week. This is usually sufficient. Use 14 days for more representative data, or 30 days to capture monthly patterns. Use 1–2 days for a quick test.

### Can I collect from multiple subscriptions?

Yes. Pass all subscription IDs as an array:

```powershell
-SubscriptionIds @("sub-1", "sub-2", "sub-3")
```

### What if my workspace is in a different subscription?

The collector handles cross-subscription workspace access automatically. Just make sure you have Reader access on the workspace's subscription.

### Can I run this on a schedule?

Yes. Use `-SkipDisclaimer` to bypass the interactive prompt:

```powershell
.\Collect-AVDData.ps1 -TenantId $t -SubscriptionIds $s -SkipDisclaimer
```

### What's the difference between this and the Enhanced AVD Evidence Pack?

| | AVD Data Collector (this tool) | Enhanced AVD Evidence Pack |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Collects raw data | Analyzes data and produces recommendations |
| **Output** | JSON files in a ZIP | HTML dashboard + 35+ CSVs + executive summary |
| **License** | MIT (open source) | Private |
| **Azure access** | Required | Optional (can use collection pack) |
| **Analysis** | None | Right-sizing, security scoring, cost optimization, UX scoring |

The typical workflow: you run the collector → send the ZIP → your consultant runs the Evidence Pack against it → you get back an HTML report with findings.

### I got an error not listed here. What should I do?

1. Note the full error message
2. Check what command you ran (redact your tenant/subscription IDs)
3. Check your PowerShell version: `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`
4. Check which Az modules you have: `Get-Module Az.* -ListAvailable | Select-Object Name, Version`
5. Send this information to your consultant or open an issue on GitHub
